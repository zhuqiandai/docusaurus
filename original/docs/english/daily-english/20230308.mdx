## NEW CONCEPT

### #23 A new house [Audio](https://www.youzack.com/ListeningExercise/Episode/3690/?mediaType=audio)

-   I had a letter from my sister yesterday.

    -   I had a package from my dad last year.

-   She said that she would come to England next year.
-   If she comes, she will get a surprise.

-   Work on it had begun before my sister left.
-   We are now living in a beautiful new house in the country.

-   It must be the only modern house in the district.
